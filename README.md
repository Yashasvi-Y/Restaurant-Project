# INDRIYA

Welcome to the Indriya Restaurant Website project â€” a lovingly crafted online presence for a modern, vibrant restaurant that aims to delight every guest. This website is designed not just to showcase the menu, but to tell the story of Indriyaâ€™s unique culinary experience, inviting visitors to explore the rich flavors, warm ambiance, and exceptional service that define the restaurant.

Built with React and modern web technologies, this project balances aesthetic beauty with practical functionality. Whether you're a first-time visitor curious about the menu or a returning guest wanting to book a table or view the latest offerings, the site provides a seamless and engaging experience.

From smooth navigation between beautifully animated sections on the homepage to a dedicated menu page featuring easy-to-use tabs for different meal categories, every detail has been thoughtfully implemented. The responsive design ensures that whether youâ€™re browsing on a phone, tablet, or desktop, the site feels intuitive and inviting.

This project is not only a showcase of technical skills but also a celebration of good food and hospitality, bringing the spirit of Indriya right to the fingertips of its guests.
